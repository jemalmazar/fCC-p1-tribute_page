**Project Description**

A tribute page for the late Anthony Bourdain.

**Tools & Methods Used**

The following were used to build this page:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (browser-sync, gulp-clean-css, gulp-rename)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

**Little Things I Learned**

- learned to use the `:root` pseudo-class to declare CSS Variables
- overlapping grid items over each other using `grid-column: 1 / -1;` and `grid-row: 1 / -1;`

**Project Epilogue**

I chose to build this page after becoming big fan of Anthony Bourdain after watching Parts Unknown. His show highlighted things I love: travel, food, and culture.

Building the page was fairly straightforward. After learning about CSS Grid through the freeCodeCamp curriculum and supplementary learning with [Wes Bos](https://cssgrid.io/), I wanted to utilize what I had learned on this project. Grid made certain tricky parts, like the overlapping elements in the hero, a little simpler. Getting images of varying widths and heights the same size and with in the program cards was a little tricky. I ended up using a fixed pixel `height` on the images but if feels a little hacky.

Overall, it was a good first project experience to get reacquainted with HTML and CSS, and to learn CSS Grid.
